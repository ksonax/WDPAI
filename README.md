# WDPAI
My first shoot at making web application.

# Technologies used:
PHP,
HTML,
CSS,
JavaScript,
PostgreSQL database.

# Description:

This project was made as part of the "Introduction To Web Applications Design" Course at Cracow Univeristy of Technology.
It was supposed to be a platform for gamers, where they could find other players to play with.
Unfortunately I didn't implement everything that I wanted to. However I'll be continuing this project in "Advanced Technologies of Web Applications Design".
This time I'm making it in ASP.NET MVC. [https://github.com/ksonax/ZTPAI] => Work In Progess ;)
